# Basilisque - Common Framework Build

## Overview
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Project-%23004880.svg?logo=github)](https://github.com/basilisque-framework/CommonFrameworkBuild)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%20License%202.0-%23D22128.svg?logo=apache&logoColor=%23D22128)](https://github.com/basilisque-framework/CommonFrameworkBuild/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)  

This project provides common build configuration for all parts of the Basilisque framework.  
It is __NOT__ recommended to use this unless you're developing a part of the framework.

## Description
This project doesn't contain any assemblies that will be deployed with the target project. Instead it only contains build time configuration (.props/.targets-files, ...) to provide all projects of the Basilisque framework with a common basic set of configuration.  
It implicitly adds a dependency to [Basilisque.CommonBuild](https://github.com/basilisque-framework/CommonBuild) to the target project. So the configuration provided by that project will also be applied.  

### Usage
Simply installing this NuGet package will automatically include the contained .props and .targets files in the build.
For more information about how this can be configured, please see the [GitHub page](https://github.com/basilisque-framework/CommonFrameworkBuild).
